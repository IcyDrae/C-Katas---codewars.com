Description:

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray
with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another
solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

// Solution
namespace MaximumSubarray

    public class Solution
    {
/*
A subarray is any continuous segment of the original array.

We need to keep track of the current sum of a potential subarray and of
the maximum sum encountered so far, so we can compare them and find out the
largest sum at the end of the array.

Loop through the array, have a sum placeholder which will be added to as the
array is traversed. Start adding continuous numbers to each other.
How to know how many numbers should be added together? 2 or 3 or 4?
That means we would try every possible subarray which is n!(factorial), which
is a lot of steps and not performant at all.

How to take a dynamic decision?

Each step of the loop we should ask ourselves: "Should we include this
number in the current subarray, or should we start a new subarray beginning
with the next number?" But how do we take that decision?
It depends on whether the current number increases or decreases the total
sum of the subarray so far.
