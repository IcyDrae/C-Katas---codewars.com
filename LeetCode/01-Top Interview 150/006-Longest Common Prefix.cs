Description:

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array
of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:

    1 <= strs.length <= 200
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
    strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

/*
We get an array of multiple strings which we assume are words in the English
language. Find the longest common prefix, which means the longest beginning
of a word that comes up in all of those words.

How to do this? First of all we need to check if all words start with the same
letter or letters. This means we have to check from the beginning of the string,
not any other position. But how to compare two strings together?
Letter by letter?
We need to stop comparing if any one of the words which is not the last one
does not begin with that prefix.

The main condition is that all words need to have that prefix.
We need to keep track of the prefix as we find out what it is.
What if we manually set the prefix to the first whole word and incrementally,
for each other word, check if the letters correspond? If they don't, reduce
the prefix by one letter from the end and then check again with the new
prefix.

                    Prefix = Prefix.Substring(0, Prefix.Length - 1);

Worst-Case time complexity analysis:

Key operations:
1. The for loop
    -> Runs from the second element to the end of "strs"
    -> For a string of length k, the loop runs at most k-1 times.
2. The while loop
    -> For each iteration of the for loop, it checks whether the current
        word contains the prefix from its beginning
    -> It does so letter by letter, though a built-in method is used.
    -> For the longest string in "strs" of length n,
        & the length of the current prefix p, the while loop can iterate
        up to p times for each string.

For each string the while loop can run up to n times, and each iteration of
"StartsWith" takes O(p). Therefore, the total work for one string is O(n²).
Across k strings, the total work becomes O(k * n²).

The Worst-Case complexity is O(k * n²).
